This section introduces how to view and download the kubeconfig file.

The kubeconfig file contains authentication information for the cluster, enabling other applications to access the cluster. KubeSphere supports automatically generating the kubeconfig file based on the current logged-in user, granting the same access permissions to other applications. For more information, please refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation].
