|Mount Path
|Set the path where the data from the ConfigMap or Secret is mounted on the container.

* The system will generate a folder based on the data from the ConfigMap or Secret and map each key-value pair to a file. Each file is named after the key, and the content is the value.

* Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/textfield.svg[textfield,18,18] to specify key-value pairs from the ConfigMap or Secret as files to be mounted. If no subpath is set, the entire ConfigMap or Secret is mounted by default. If a subpath is used, files mounted to the container will not dynamically update with changes in the ConfigMap or Secret.

|Select Specific Keys
|Mount key-value pairs from the ConfigMap or Secret as files to the container. Files mounted to the container will dynamically update with changes in the ConfigMap or Secret. Click **Add** to mount multiple key-value pairs.

* **Key**: The key of the key-value pair in the ConfigMap or Secret to be mounted.
