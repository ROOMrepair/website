|Parameter |Description

|Rolling Update (Recommended)
|Gradually replace old pod replicas with new ones. During the update, the business traffic is load-balanced between old and new pod replicas, ensuring uninterrupted service. If you choose this strategy, you need to further configure **Maximum Unavailable Pods** and **Maximum Extra Pods**.

|Simultaneous Update
|Delete all existing pod replicas and create new ones. The service is interrupted during the update.
