| Parameter | Description

| Access Control
| Access permissions for the container process.

* **Privileged Mode**: Run the container process as the **root** user on the host.

* **Allow Privilege Escalation**: Allow the container process to gain more privileges than the parent process. This option is enabled by default when **Privileged Mode** is enabled.

* **Root Directory Read-Only**: Set the root directory of the container filesystem to read-only.

|User and User Group
|
The users and user groups running the entry point of container processes.

* **Run as Non-root**: Checks if the container will run as the **root** user before starting. If the container is set to run as the **root** user, it won't start. When this feature is enabled, the system will ignore the **Privileged mode** setting.

* **User**: The UID (User ID) executing the container process entry point. Defaults to the UID specified in the image metadata.

* **User Group**: The GID (Group ID) executing the container process entry point. Defaults to the default GID of the container runtime.

|SELinux Context
|The SELinux labels for the container process, including **Level**, **Role**, **Type**, and **User**. For more information, refer to the link:https://www.selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page[SELinux Documentation].

| Capabilities
| Additional capabilities added to or removed from the container process in the Linux system. Refer to the link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html[Linux Documentation] for the list of Linux process capabilities.

* When adding or removing capabilities for the container process, you need to remove the **CAP_** prefix from the capability names. For example, entering **SYS_TIME** in the **Drop** text box will remove the **CAP_SYS_TIME** capability from the container process.

* Click **Add** to set multiple instructions for adding or removing capabilities.
