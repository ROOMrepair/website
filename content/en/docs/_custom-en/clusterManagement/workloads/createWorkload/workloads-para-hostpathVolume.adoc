Mount a file or directory on the node where the pod is located to the container using a HostPath volume.

* Files or folders under the same path on different nodes may differ, so pod replicas on different nodes may read different data from the HostPath volume.

* Ensure that the mounted path exists on the node where the pod is located, and the container process has the necessary permissions. Otherwise, the container process will be unable to read from or write to the data in the HostPath volume.
