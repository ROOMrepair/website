This section describes how to manage service accounts.

Service accounts are special accounts provided by KubeSphere for applications. Applications, whether internal or external to the cluster, can use service accounts to access the KubeSphere's API server.

Key distinctions between service accounts and user accounts include:

- Service accounts cannot be authenticated using usernames and passwords; they can only be authenticated through tokens.
- Service accounts cannot be used to log in to the KubeSphere web console.

You can create service accounts and control their permissions by assigning roles. This allows service accounts to access specific resources and perform designated operations. The system automatically creates a service account named **default** in each project. When creating a pod, if no service account is specified, the pod is assigned the **default** service account of the project.
