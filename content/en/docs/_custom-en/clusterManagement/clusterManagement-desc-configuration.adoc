This section explains how to manage configuration resources.

KubeSphere supports managing the following three types of configuration resources:

* Secret: Contains Base64-encoded key-value pairs, used to store sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, and keys.

* ConfigMap: Contains plain-text key-value pairs, used to store regular configuration data.

* Service Account: Stores access information for the current KubeSphere cluster, used to provide access to the KubeSphere cluster for applications.
