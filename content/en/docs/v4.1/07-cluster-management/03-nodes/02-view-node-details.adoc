|OS Version
|The operating system and its version on the node.

|OS Type
|The operating system type on the node.

|Area |Description

|Health Status
|Displays the node's network, memory, disk, process pressure, and readiness status. If shown as image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/check-healthy.svg["healthy",15px,15px], it indicates normal status; if shown as image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/substract-unhealthy.svg["unhealthy",15px,15px], it indicates an alert.

* **Network Availability**: Whether the network configuration of the node is correct.

* **Memory Pressure**: Whether the remaining memory on the node is less than the threshold, with the default threshold being 100 MiB.

* **Disk Pressure**: Whether the remaining disk space or inode count on the node is less than the threshold, with the default disk space threshold being 10% of the total disk space and the default inode count threshold being 5% of the maximum inode count.

* **PID Pressure**: Whether the number of processes that can be created on the node is less than the threshold. The newly installed KubeSphere cluster does not set a process count threshold by default.

* **Readiness**: Whether the node is ready to accept pods.

|Taints
|Taints configured on the current node. For more information, see link:../05-edit-node-taints/[Edit Node Taints].
