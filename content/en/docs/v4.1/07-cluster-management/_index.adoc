This chapter explains how to manage all resources in individual or multiple clusters within KubeSphere as a cluster member.

KubeSphere supports the management of multiple clusters. Each cluster can be authorized for multiple workspaces. Each workspace can include multiple regular projects. As a multi-tenant system, KubeSphere supports role-based access control for user permissions at the platform, cluster, workspace, and project levels.
