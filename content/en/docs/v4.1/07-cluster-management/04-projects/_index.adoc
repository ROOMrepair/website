This section explains how to manage projects in a cluster.

In KubeSphere, projects are used to group and manage resources. You can create resources within a project, invite users to join the project, and set different permissions for different users. There are two types of projects in KubeSphere:

- User Projects: Projects created by users for managing their resources.

- System Projects: Projects automatically created by KubeSphere for managing system resources. It is generally not recommended to create user resources in the system projects.
