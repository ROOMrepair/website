This section explains how to manage cluster visibility. Cluster visibility controls the cluster authorization to workspaces. After a cluster is authorized to workspaces, you can view and manage the cluster resources in the workspaces.

* A cluster can be authorized to multiple workspaces, allowing resources within the workspaces to run on that cluster.

* Multiple clusters can be authorized to one workspace, enabling the creation of multi-cluster projects within the workspace.
