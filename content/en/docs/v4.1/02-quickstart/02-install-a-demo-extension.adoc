KubeSphere extensions run on KubeSphere Core to extend and enhance the capabilities of KubeSphere, further meeting different business requirements of enterprises.

This section demonstrates how to install extensions in the {ks_product-en} web console, taking DevOps as an example. After the DevOps installation is complete, you can create DevOps projects in a workspace. 
// For more information on DevOps projects, please refer to link:../../11-use-extensions/01-devops/[DevOps].


== Prerequisites

You should have the **platform-admin** role on {ks_product-en} platform. For more information, please refer to link:../../05-users-and-roles/01-users/[Users] and link:../../05-users-and-roles/02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

During the installation, it detects whether the extension has dependencies. Dependencies are categorized as required and optional.

If a required dependency is **Not Ready**, you need to install the required version first to ensure the normal use of the extension. Optional dependencies do not affect the installation of the extension.
