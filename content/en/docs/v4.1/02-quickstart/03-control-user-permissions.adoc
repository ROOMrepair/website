This section explains how to create users and control their permissions by roles in workspaces and projects. 
For more information on permission control, please refer to link:../../05-users-and-roles/[Users and Roles].

As a multi-tenant system, KubeSphere supports controlling user permissions based on roles at the platform, cluster, workspace, and project levels, achieving logical resource isolation.
