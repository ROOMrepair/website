== Network Requirements

* Ensure that the DNS addresses in **/etc/resolv.conf** are accessible; otherwise, it may cause DNS issues in the cluster.

* If your network configuration uses firewall rules or security groups, make sure that the infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. It is recommended to disable the firewall.

* Supported CNI plugins: Calico and Flannel. Other plugins such as Cilium and Kube-OVN are also compatible, but note that they have not been fully tested.

== Port Requirements

Certain ports are used for communication between services. If you have firewall rules in your network configuration, ensure that the infrastructure components can communicate with each other through specific ports. These ports serve as communication endpoints for certain processes or services.
