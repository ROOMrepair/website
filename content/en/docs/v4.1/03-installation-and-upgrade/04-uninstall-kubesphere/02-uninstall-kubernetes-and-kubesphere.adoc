The uninstallation method for Kubernetes described in this section only applies to Kubernetes installed using KubeKey. If your Kubernetes is not installed through KubeKey, please refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-reset/[Kubernetes Documentation] for uninstallation instructions.

The uninstallation will cause business interruption to the KubeSphere cluster and cannot be undone. Please proceed with caution.

== Prerequisites

* You should get the installation configuration file **config-sample.yaml** and transfer it to the cluster nodes where you will perform the uninstallation. For more information, refer to link:../../../03-installation-and-upgrade/02-install-kubesphere/02-install-kubernetes-and-kubesphere[Install Kubernetes and {ks_product-en}].

If you are unable to get the installation configuration file **config-sample.yaml**, you need to refer to link:../../../03-installation-and-upgrade/02-install-kubesphere/02-install-kubernetes-and-kubesphere[Install Kubernetes and {ks_product-en}] to recreate the **config-sample.yaml** file. When recreating the file, make sure that the cluster information in the file matches the current state of the cluster. Otherwise, the uninstallation process may encounter errors.
