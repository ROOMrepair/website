During the installation, it detects whether the extension has dependencies. Dependencies are categorized as required and optional.

If a required dependency is **Not Ready**, you need to install the required version first to ensure the normal use of the extension. Optional dependencies do not affect the installation of the extension.

Once the installation is complete, the extension is enabled by default. You can configure, upgrade, disable, or uninstall extensions in the Extensions Center.
