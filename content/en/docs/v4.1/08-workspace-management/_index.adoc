This section explains how to manage resources within a workspace.

In KubeSphere, a workspace is used to group resources for management. Cluster administrators can authorize one or more clusters to a workspace, allowing resources within the workspace to run on the cluster. Each workspace can contain multiple projects. Users can be invited to join a workspace and gain view and management permissions for workspace resources based on their workspace roles.

After the {ks_product-en} installation is complete, the system will automatically create the **system-workspace** workspace, which includes system projects for managing system resources.
