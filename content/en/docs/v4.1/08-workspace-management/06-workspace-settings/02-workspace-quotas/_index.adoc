This section explains how to view and manage workspace resource quotas.

In KubeSphere, multiple clusters can be authorized to the same workspace. You can set resource quotas for each cluster within a workspace. Workspace quotas consist of two types of settings:

* Resource Request: Container resource request is the resources reserved by the system for a single container. Workspace resource request is the maximum sum of all container resource requests for a workspace running in a single cluster. KubeSphere currently supports setting CPU request and memory request for workspaces.

* Resource Limit: Container resource limit is the maximum resources that a single container can utilize. Workspace resource limit is the maximum sum of all container resource limits for a workspace running in a single cluster. KubeSphere currently supports setting CPU limit and memory limit for workspaces.
