KubeSphere is a container management platform that supports multi-tenancy. Similar to Kubernetes, it controls user permissions through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to achieve logical resource isolation.

Resources in KubeSphere are divided into four levels: Platform, Workspace, Cluster, and Project. All resources belong to these four levels, and access to resources can be controlled through roles at each level. Each level comes with multiple built-in roles by default, and you can also create custom roles with specific permissions.

Workspace serves as the smallest tenant unit, providing resource isolation capabilities across clusters. Members within a Workspace can create projects in authorized clusters and collaborate on projects by inviting users.

This section explains how to manage access permissions in KubeSphere, including user and platform role management.
