This section explains how to edit platform role information.

You can edit the alias and description of platform roles created by users. KubeSphere does not support editing preset platform roles and the names of platform roles.

== Prerequisites

You should have the pass:a,q[{ks_permission}] permission on the {ks_product-en} platform. For more information, see link:../../01-users/[Users] and link:../../02-platform-roles/[Platform Roles].

== Steps

. Log in to the {ks_product-en} web console with a user who has the pass:a,q[{ks_permission}] permission.
. Click pass:a,q[{ks_menu}].
. Select **Platform Roles** from the left navigation pane.
. Click image:/images/ks-qkcp/zh/icons/more.svg[more,18,18] on the right side of the platform role, then choose **Edit Information** from the drop-down list.
. In the **Edit Information** dialog, set the alias and description of the platform role, then click **OK**.
