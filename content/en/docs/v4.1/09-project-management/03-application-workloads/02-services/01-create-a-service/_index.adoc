KubeSphere supports creating services and their backend workloads in the following ways:

- Create Stateful Services: Create services with an internal access mode set to Headless, and simultaneously create a StatefulSet as the backend workload for the service.

- Create Stateless Services: Create services with an internal access mode set to VirtualIP, and simultaneously create a Deployment as the backend workload for the service.

- Create External Services: Direct service traffic to services outside the cluster.

- Specify Workloads: Create services with an internal access mode set to Headless or VirtualIP, and use existing workloads in the project as the backend workload for the service.
